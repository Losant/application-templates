# Losant Application Templates

This repository contains a collection of [Application Templates](https://docs.losant.com/templates/overview) for the [Losant IoT Platform](https://www.losant.com).

These templates provide a set of real-world reference implementations that you can use for:
* Architecture guidance.
* Implementation best practices.
* Starting points for your own applications.

## How to Use Losant Application Templates

For all sandbox and enterprise users within Losant's managed cloud environment, these templates will appear directly in the Losant user interface whenever you add a new application.

## How to Import a Template from this Repository
If you're using a dedicated Losant installation or a white-label environment, these templates will not appear in the Losant user interface. If you'd like to use any of these templates, you can import them from this repository.

1. Clone this repository to your local computer.
2. Zip the folder that contains the template you'd like to use.
3. Use Losant's [Application Import](https://docs.losant.com/applications/import-export/#importing-an-application) functionality to import the zipped template as a new application.

## The Templates
Each template is designed to demonstrate a specific set of Losant's capability through real-world examples:

### 1. Weather Station
The [Weather Station Template](https://docs.losant.com/templates/weather-station) requests weather data from an external API to populate a personal weather dashboard. This template provides a complete implementation of the [Losant Walkthrough](https://docs.losant.com/getting-started/walkthrough/).
