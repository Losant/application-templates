      Users who are not logged in will be redirected to this page when they try
      to visit the home page. This is a simple login form; when the user submits
      the form, it will hit the POST /login endpoint with the email and password
      submitted by the user. If the credentials are valid, the user will get an
      authentication cookie and will be redirected to the Home page.

      Here is an example home page, which renders only for logged-in users.
      Within the endpoint that renders this template, we redirect to the Login
      page if the experience user is not logged in. This page renders within
      your Example Layout at the position of the {{ page }} tag.
